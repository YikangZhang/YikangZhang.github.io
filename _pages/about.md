Who am I?
------
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Crime, Security, and Law, where I explore how social influences shape decision-making and (un)ethical behavior. My work is guided by a commitment to open science, inclusive mentorship, and research-informed teaching. Through this lens, I strive to produce research that advances scientific understanding while contributing to real-world prevention efforts.
